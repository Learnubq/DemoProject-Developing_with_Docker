# Using Docker for Local Development
This is a repository to showcase my demo project where I use Docker for local development/to run a node .js app.

## Project Description

1. I cloned a Dockerfile for a Nodejs application and built a Docker image
2. I then ran the Nodejs application in the Docker container and connected it to the MongoDB database container locally
3. I also ran a MongoExpress container as a UI of the MongoDB database

**I have included a .md file (markdown file) to specify the Bash CLI commands and steps used to carry out specific tasks in the project.

## Acknowlegement
I would like to thank Nana and TWN for the opportunity to delve into the world of DevOps engineering through the TWN DevOps Bootcamp. Nana's approach to teaching is very effective and I feel concepts are introduced with the right amount of depth, whilst ensuring you are not overwhelmed with technical jargon, techniques, or tools. She has made a task that initially felt like a mountain to climb without directions, straightforward. I no longer had to worry about whether I was learning the correct concepts or missing out on any important information or skills. Thanks TWN!
